The project focuses on predicting equipment failure in a manufacturing plant using a combination of data analysis and predictive modeling. It involves:

Assignment2_Guide.docx: This serves as a guide for completing Assignment 2, which likely involves working with a dataset and building a model to predict equipment failure. It provides detailed instructions, methodology, and requirements for the assignment.

equipment_failure_dataset.csv: The dataset consists of relevant features related to equipment performance, environmental conditions, and historical failure events. This dataset will be used for training and evaluating predictive models.

Equipment Failure Prediction in a Manufacturing Plant (1).docx: This document might provide theoretical background or a case study on equipment failure prediction, explaining methodologies and factors considered for effective prediction.

ProblemStatement_Predict_Equipment_Failure.docx: The problem statement defines the key challenge: developing a model that can accurately predict when equipment in a manufacturing plant is likely to fail, potentially helping to minimize downtime and optimize maintenance.
